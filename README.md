# rezeptefabrik

Here you can see one of my first projects, the "recipe factory". This project
was planned and written together with a project partner for the 4th grade of
state vocational school, since a large part of the laboratory revolves around
the project, we had over 90 working hours to plan and implement the project.

This project is a web application that represents a website for recipes. This
project includes a database with a total of 10 tables, user management and
recipe management.

There are 3 user types!

The first is the guest and can only view 5 randomly selected recipes on the
index page.

The second is the user himself! After registration, various functions are
available to him. These functions include, for example, viewing all recipes,
creating your own recipes, rating other recipes, and marking them as favourites.

The third is the admin and not only has all the functions of the user, but the
admin area is also available to him. In this area he can not only get an
overview of all users, but also manage them (i.e. edit, delete), the same
function is also available for recipes, units of measure, ingredients, etc.

We try to improve and expand this code again and again in the future.
