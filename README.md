# rezeptfabrik

Here you can see one of our first projects, the "rezeptfabrik". This project
was planned and written together for the 4th grade of state vocational school.
Because a large part of the laboratory revolves around the project, we had invested
over 90 working hours for project planning, implementation and documentation.

This project is a web application that is used do create and manage recipes. It
includes a database with a total of 10 tables and a user management.

The user management is divided into a registration area, a login area, a logout area, 
and a separate area for the administrator.

Unregistered users can only see the index page of our application. There is a small 
compilation of recipes that changes randomly every day. In a registration form, users
can enter their data and after successfully logging in, they have access to all the 
recipes in the collection. A registered user, you have the option of creating your 
own recipes. 

In the creation form, you can enter the title, ingredients with the associated quantity 
and unit of measure and a description of the preparation. A type and a category are also 
assigned to the recipe. Types are divided into “with meat”, “vegetarian” and “vegan” and 
the individual categories are breakfast, soup, starter, main course, dessert, dinner, and 
drink. If you want, you can also upload a photo.

If the user is not satisfied with his recipe and would like to edit it, there is a separate
form where he can change the data, and there is also the option of deleting the recipe.
The registered users can save favourite recipes and, if they wish, they can give ratings for 
the recipes of the other users. The average of the ratings for each recipe is calculated and 
displayed for each recipe.

Furthermore, a profile page is available to the user, which is divided into the areas of user 
data, own recipes, and favourite recipes.

There is also an administrator area that only administrators can see in the navigation bar. 
There the administrator can view and manage all users and recipes as well as the roles,
units of measure, types and categories.


We try to improve and expand this code again and again in the future.
